## ðŸš€ About Me
I am currently a student at the University of Applied Science in OsnabrÃ¼ck, pursuing a degree in "Informatik - Medieninformatik (B.Sc.)".
Besides that, im currently working as a part of IT Support Applications at Vogelsang GmbH & Co. KG, located in Essen(Oldenburg) in Germany, where I'm going to work on my bachelor's thesis.
I got most of my software engineering experience in Java and C++, but my university focuses on learning concepts and theory in general for every programming language instead of just focusing on one.
